MySQL Fixtures Base Image

This is a MySQL Database image tuned for fast start up times, designed to be
extended for purposes of providing fixtures.

The Official MySQL Image, while Ok to use as a normal database, does too many
things on startup. Instead we install the database directory and preload the
schema during build. This allows us to use Docker's copy-on-write filesystem to
efficiently discard any data written after container start.

The result is an image that, once built, can be stopped and started in a
fraction of a second, making it suitable to use as part of your integration
test suite.

How to use this image
---------------------

Extend this image within your `Dockerfile` using the FROM directive. Do all the
fixture seed during the build. You can use any tools you want as long as
you wrap the commands with `start-mysql` and `stop-mysql`. The changes to the
database directory will then be commited as a file system layer by docker.

Example Dockerfile:
```
FROM zanox/mysql

COPY schema.sql /
RUN start-mysql && \
    mysql < /schema.sql && \
    stop-mysql
```

The reasoning behind using the start and stop commands is that it allows you
to split up your setup procedure and leverage docker's caching mechanism
with fixtures that are large and edited less often placed higher up.

The disadvantage is of course COW duplication of any touched tables for each RUN
directive.

MySQL Daemon itself is started by S6. You can add in more services to start in
together with MySQL by adding the service definitions to run files:
`services.d/<service_name>/run`. Test that your services work by running `make
run` followed by manually invoking S6: `/init`

Notes on the Makefile
=====================

You can try this project out by running `make build start` and connecting to
default mysql port on your dockerhost. The Makefile makes trying the project
out consistent and simple. I would encourage you to use it as a template for
your own project.
